<h1>Learning Portfolio</h1>

<div class="intro">
    <p>Throughout the semester, you'll build a single Word document that grows into your learning portfolio. This isn't something you compile at the end—it's a document you develop week by week, adding artifacts and reflections as you complete them.</p>
    <p>The portfolio serves two purposes: it demonstrates your growth in evaluating technology, and it develops your professional document skills in Word.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Document You're Building</h2>

<p>Your portfolio is one Word document (.docx) that includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cover page</strong> — Title, your name, course, date</li>
    <li><strong>Table of contents</strong> — Dynamic, auto-generated from headings</li>
    <li><strong>Six artifact sections</strong> — One for each learning outcome, each containing:
        <ul>
            <li>The artifact itself (your work)</li>
            <li>Your reflection on that artifact</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Synthesis reflection</strong> — Final section, added at end of semester</li>
    <li><strong>Table of figures</strong> — If you include images, charts, or screenshots</li>
</ul>

<h2>Word Skills You'll Develop</h2>

<div class="skills">
    <p>Building this document teaches you professional Word skills:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Heading styles</strong> — Required for the table of contents to work</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic table of contents</strong> — Updates automatically as you add content</li>
        <li><strong>Section breaks</strong> — Different formatting for different parts</li>
        <li><strong>Cover page</strong> — Professional document design</li>
        <li><strong>Figure captions</strong> — Proper labeling for images and charts</li>
        <li><strong>Table of figures</strong> — Auto-generated from captions</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-references</strong> — "See Figure 3" that updates if numbering changes</li>
        <li><strong>Consistent formatting</strong> — Using styles instead of manual formatting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are skills you'll use in any professional or academic context.</p>
</div>

<h2>Submission Schedule</h2>

<p>You'll submit your portfolio document multiple times throughout the semester. Each submission builds on the previous one.</p>

<div class="timeline">
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Checkpoint</th>
            <th>When</th>
            <th>What's Expected</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1: Structure</td>
            <td>End of Week 3</td>
            <td>Cover page, table of contents, section headings for all six outcomes (empty sections are fine). Document structure is in place.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2: First Artifacts</td>
            <td>End of Week 6</td>
            <td>At least two artifacts with reflections added. Table of contents updates correctly.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3: Midpoint</td>
            <td>End of Week 9</td>
            <td>At least four artifacts with reflections. Table of figures if applicable. Document formatting is consistent.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4: Final</td>
            <td>End of Week 14</td>
            <td>All six artifacts, all reflections, synthesis reflection. Complete, polished document.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h2>The Six Artifacts</h2>

<p>Select one piece of work demonstrating each learning outcome:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Outcome</th>
        <th>Example Artifacts</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Explain how AI models work and select appropriate tools</td>
        <td>Model matching exercise, training data investigation</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Apply the evaluation framework</td>
        <td>Framework application from any unit</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Communicate findings clearly</td>
        <td>Findings paper, methodology audit, critique</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Interpret and critique data visualizations</td>
        <td>Graph evaluation, benchmark analysis, "Make It Lie" exercise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Design and conduct controlled comparisons</td>
        <td>Reproducibility test, prompt sensitivity exercise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Evaluate source reliability</td>
        <td>Training data detective, any source evaluation work</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>You choose which artifacts best represent your abilities. You may revise earlier work before including it.</p>

<h2>Reflections</h2>

<h3>Artifact Reflections</h3>

<p>For each artifact, write 1-2 paragraphs addressing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why does this piece demonstrate the outcome?</li>
    <li>What would you improve if you did it again?</li>
    <li>What did you learn from the process?</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
    <p><strong>Be specific.</strong> "I learned a lot" says nothing. "I realized I was trusting AI-generated citations without checking them" says something.</p>
</div>

<h3>Synthesis Reflection</h3>

<p>Added at the end of the semester. One page addressing:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How has your thinking about AI and technology evaluation changed?</li>
    <li>Which skill was hardest for you to develop? Why?</li>
    <li>If you encountered a completely new AI tool tomorrow, how would you approach evaluating it?</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It's Graded</h2>

<h3>Checkpoints 1-3 (During Semester)</h3>

<p>Graded on completion and document structure, not content quality:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Did you submit on time?</li>
    <li>Does your table of contents work?</li>
    <li>Are you using heading styles correctly?</li>
    <li>Is formatting consistent?</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll receive feedback on Word skills and structure. This is formative—helping you improve, not penalizing you.</p>

<h3>Checkpoint 4: Final Portfolio</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Criterion</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
        <th>What I'm Looking For</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Artifacts</td>
        <td>30%</td>
        <td>All six outcomes represented; artifacts actually demonstrate the claimed outcome</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Reflections</td>
        <td>25%</td>
        <td>Honest self-assessment; specific observations, not generic praise</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Synthesis</td>
        <td>20%</td>
        <td>Evidence of genuine growth; clear articulation of your evaluation approach</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Document Quality</td>
        <td>25%</td>
        <td>Professional formatting; working TOC and table of figures; consistent styles; polished presentation</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>In Week 1, you'll create your portfolio document with:</p>

<ol>
    <li>A cover page</li>
    <li>A table of contents (Insert → Table of Contents)</li>
    <li>Six sections with Heading 1 styles, one for each outcome</li>
    <li>A final section for your synthesis reflection</li>
</ol>

<p>The document will be mostly empty—that's expected. You're building the structure first. Content comes as you complete activities throughout the semester.</p>

<div class="note">
    <p><strong>Don't wait until the end.</strong> Students who try to build this document in Week 14 struggle with the Word skills because they didn't practice incrementally. The checkpoint submissions exist to keep you on track.</p>
</div>

<h2>A Note on Revision</h2>

<p>You may revise any artifact before including it in your portfolio. That's the point—learning means improving. Just don't fabricate work you didn't do.</p>
