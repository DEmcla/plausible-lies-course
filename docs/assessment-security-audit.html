<h1>Personal Security Audit</h1>

<p style="color: #666; font-size: 0.9em;"><em>Document version: 1.0 | Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

<div class="overview">
    <p><strong>Weight:</strong> 25% of final grade</p>
    <p><strong>Due:</strong> End of Week 5 (online) / Week 10 (in-person)</p>
    <p><strong>Format:</strong> Written report with evidence, 1500-2500 words</p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You will audit your own digital security and privacy practices, identify risks, and implement real changes. This is not a hypothetical exercise—you will make actual improvements to your digital life and document what you did.</p>

<div class="success">
    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> The evaluation skills you're learning in this course apply to your own technology use. This assignment asks you to turn that critical lens on yourself.</p>
</div>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<h3>Part 1: Audit (What You Have)</h3>

<p>Examine your current digital footprint across these areas:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Area</th>
        <th>What to Examine</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Accounts</strong></td>
        <td>What accounts do you have? Which have the same password? Which have MFA enabled? Which have you forgotten about?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Passwords</strong></td>
        <td>How do you manage passwords? Are they unique? Strong? Stored securely?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Privacy Settings</strong></td>
        <td>What are your settings on major platforms (social media, Google, Apple)? What data are you sharing?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>App Permissions</strong></td>
        <td>What permissions have you granted to apps on your phone? Location? Contacts? Camera? Microphone?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Data Exposure</strong></td>
        <td>What can someone find about you through search? What have you posted publicly?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>AI Tools</strong></td>
        <td>What AI tools have you given access to your data? What did you agree to?</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<div class="note">
    <p><strong>You don't have to share sensitive details.</strong> You can say "I found 3 accounts using the same weak password" without revealing which accounts or what the password was.</p>
</div>

<h3>Part 2: Risk Assessment</h3>

<p>For each issue you discover, assess:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Likelihood</strong> — How probable is this risk actually being exploited?</li>
    <li><strong>Severity</strong> — If it happened, how bad would it be?</li>
    <li><strong>Priority</strong> — Given likelihood and severity, how urgently should you address this?</li>
</ul>

<p>Be realistic. Not every vulnerability is an emergency. Distinguish between theoretical risks and practical ones.</p>

<h3>Part 3: Actions Taken</h3>

<p>Implement at least <strong>five meaningful changes</strong> to improve your security or privacy. Examples:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Set up a password manager and migrate passwords</li>
    <li>Enable MFA on important accounts</li>
    <li>Review and restrict app permissions</li>
    <li>Adjust privacy settings on social media</li>
    <li>Delete unused accounts</li>
    <li>Review and revoke AI tool access to your data</li>
    <li>Set up a separate email for signups</li>
    <li>Review what data Google/Apple has collected about you</li>
</ul>

<div class="important">
    <p><strong>Document with evidence.</strong> Screenshots (with sensitive info redacted), before/after comparisons, or other proof that you actually made changes. "I enabled MFA" without evidence will receive reduced credit.</p>
</div>

<h3>Part 4: Reflection</h3>

<p>Conclude with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What surprised you most about your digital footprint?</li>
    <li>What trade-offs did you make (convenience vs. security)?</li>
    <li>What will you do differently going forward?</li>
    <li>What risks did you decide to accept, and why?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Document Structure</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Introduction</strong> — Brief overview of your approach</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Findings</strong> — What you discovered across the six areas</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Assessment</strong> — Prioritized list of issues with severity/likelihood analysis</li>
    <li><strong>Actions Taken</strong> — What you changed, with evidence</li>
    <li><strong>Reflection</strong> — What you learned, trade-offs made, future intentions</li>
</ol>

<h2>What Makes a Strong Audit</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Thoroughness</strong> — You examined multiple areas, not just the obvious ones</li>
    <li><strong>Realistic risk assessment</strong> — Neither paranoid nor dismissive</li>
    <li><strong>Meaningful actions</strong> — Changes that actually improve security, with evidence</li>
    <li><strong>Honest reflection</strong> — Acknowledging trade-offs and accepted risks</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Avoid</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Superficial audit</strong> — Only checking one or two areas</li>
    <li><strong>No evidence</strong> — Claiming changes without proof</li>
    <li><strong>Unrealistic risk assessment</strong> — Treating everything as critical or nothing as important</li>
    <li><strong>Trivial changes</strong> — Five minor tweaks don't equal one meaningful improvement</li>
</ul>

<h2>Privacy Note</h2>

<div class="note">
    <p>This assignment asks you to examine personal information. You control what you share in your submission:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Redact account names, passwords, or other sensitive details in screenshots</li>
        <li>Describe findings in general terms where appropriate</li>
        <li>Focus on the process and learning, not exposing your personal data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is demonstrating that you conducted a thorough audit and made real improvements—not revealing your secrets.</p>
</div>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>See the Grading Rubrics document for detailed criteria. In summary:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Criterion</th>
        <th>Weight</th>
    </tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Documentation (clear, organized, followable)</td>
        <td>20%</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>Submit as a Word document (.docx) or PDF through Canvas by the deadline. Include screenshots or other evidence as embedded images or an appendix.</p>
