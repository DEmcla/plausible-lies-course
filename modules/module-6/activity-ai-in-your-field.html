<h1>AI in Your Field</h1>

<div class="intro">
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Connect the evaluation skills you've developed to your specific major, career interests, or professional field. Understand how AI is being used—and how to approach it critically—in your area.</p>
    <p><strong>Time:</strong> 60-90 minutes</p>
</div>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>The AI evaluation framework you've learned is transferable across any field. But <em>how</em> AI is being used—and the specific risks and opportunities—varies significantly by domain. Whether you're going into healthcare, business, education, arts, law, or any other field, AI will be part of your professional landscape.</p>

<p>This activity helps you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify AI tools currently used in your field</li>
    <li>Apply the evaluation framework to domain-specific tools</li>
    <li>Understand field-specific ethical considerations</li>
    <li>Develop a personal approach to AI in your career</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 1: Field Mapping</h2>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 1: Identify Your Field</h3>
    <p>What's your major, intended career, or professional area of interest? Be specific if possible (e.g., "marketing" not just "business"; "elementary education" not just "education").</p>
</div>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 2: Research AI in Your Field</h3>
    <p>Search for how AI is being used in your field. Look for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Industry articles about AI adoption</li>
        <li>Specific tools marketed to your profession</li>
        <li>Professional association statements about AI</li>
        <li>News stories about AI impacts (positive and negative)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Identify <strong>at least 3 specific AI tools or applications</strong> being used in your field.</p>
</div>

<div class="example">
    <h3>Examples by Field</h3>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Example AI Applications</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Healthcare</td>
            <td>Diagnostic imaging analysis, clinical decision support, drug interaction checkers, medical transcription</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Education</td>
            <td>Automated grading, personalized learning platforms, plagiarism detection, tutoring chatbots</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Automated reporting, fact-checking tools, transcription, content recommendations</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h2>Part 2: Framework Application</h2>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 3: Evaluate One Tool</h3>
    <p>Choose <strong>one AI tool</strong> relevant to your field and apply the evaluation framework:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Component</th>
            <th>Questions for Your Field</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Function</strong></td>
            <td>What does this tool claim to do? Does it deliver? What tasks does it replace or augment?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Data</strong></td>
            <td>What data does it need to function? What happens to data you input? Is client/patient/student data involved?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Failures</strong></td>
            <td>What are the consequences of errors in your field? How serious could mistakes be?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Access</strong></td>
            <td>Who has access to this tool? Does it create disparities within your profession?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Terms</strong></td>
            <td>What do professional ethics codes say about AI use? Are there regulatory considerations?</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><strong>Impact</strong></td>
            <td>How might widespread adoption affect your profession? Jobs? Quality of work?</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<h2>Part 3: Ethical Considerations</h2>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 4: Field-Specific Ethics</h3>
    <p>Consider the ethical dimensions specific to your field:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Professional responsibility:</strong> What obligations do practitioners in your field have regarding AI use?</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Should clients/patients/students know when AI is being used?</li>
        <li><strong>Liability:</strong> Who is responsible if AI makes an error—the tool, the user, the organization?</li>
        <li><strong>Human oversight:</strong> What decisions should always involve a human in your field?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="warning">
    <h3>High-Stakes Fields</h3>
    <p>Some fields have particularly high stakes for AI errors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Misdiagnosis, treatment errors, privacy violations</li>
        <li><strong>Law:</strong> Missed precedents, incorrect legal advice, bias in case outcomes</li>
        <li><strong>Education:</strong> Unfair grading, missed learning needs, student privacy</li>
        <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Biased lending decisions, investment losses, fraud</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your field involves vulnerable populations or significant consequences, extra scrutiny is warranted.</p>
</div>

<h2>Part 4: Your AI Approach</h2>

<div class="exercise">
    <h3>Step 5: Personal AI Strategy</h3>
    <p>Based on your research and analysis, develop your personal approach to AI in your field:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which AI tools might you use, and for what purposes?</li>
        <li>What will you <em>not</em> delegate to AI?</li>
        <li>How will you stay informed as AI evolves in your field?</li>
        <li>What evaluation criteria will you apply to new tools?</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="key-insight">
    <h3>The Transferable Skill</h3>
    <p>The specific tools you researched today will likely be obsolete in 5 years. But the <em>framework</em> for evaluating them—Function, Data, Failures, Access, Terms, Impact—will remain relevant throughout your career. You now have a systematic approach to evaluating any technology you encounter.</p>
</div>

<p>Submit a document (500-750 words) containing:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Your field</strong> and why you chose it</li>
    <li><strong>Three AI tools/applications</strong> currently used in your field</li>
    <li><strong>Framework evaluation</strong> of one tool (address all six components)</li>
